## 1. Installing Podman

Podman is a containerization tool similar to Docker but focuses on providing a more secure and rootless container environment. Here's how you can install it according to your system preferences.

### Prerequisites
1.  Virtualisation must be enable in the system


<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Linux (Ubuntu)">
        <Note>The podman package is available in the official repositories for Ubuntu 20.10 and newer.</Note>

        Open a terminal on your Ubuntu system.<br />
        Update the package list to ensure you have the latest information about available packages:
        ```bash Terminal
        # Ubuntu 20.10 and newer
        sudo apt-get update
        ```
        Install Podman using the following command:
        ```bash Terminal
        # Ubuntu 20.10 and newer
        sudo apt-get install podman -y
        ```

        After the installation is complete, you can verify the installation by checking the Podman version:
        ```bash Terminal
        podman --version
        ```
        Initialize podman machine named `orca` to configure Podman to work with your user account without requiring root privileges. This is called the "rootless" mode, which enhances security:

        ```bash Terminal
        podman machine init orca
        ```

        Start podman machine named `orca`
        <Warning>You might get this error, if you did not enable **Virtualisation** in your system `Getting error (Error: exec: "qemu-system-x86_64": executable file not found in $PATH) Issue`.</Warning>

        Enabling virtulisation: <br />
            1. To verify, you can check virtulisation status using below command  <br />
                `sudo dmesg | grep kvm` <br />
                It will say kvm: disabled by bios if the setting is disabled  <br />
            2. Then, run following command to enable it<br />
                `sudo modprobe kvm-intel` <br />
                if it is also keep giving the following error -  `could not insert 'kvm_intel': Operation not supported` <br />
            3. **You have to go in the BIOS and enable Virtualization manually.**
        ```bash Terminal
        podman machine start orca
        ```

        Verify the `orca` machine status

        ```bash Terminal
        podman machine ls
        ```
        <Note>Note that the above steps assume that you're using a Ubuntu version (typically versions 20.04 and later). If you're using an older version of Ubuntu, the process might be slightly different.</Note>
    
        After completing these steps, you should have Podman successfully installed on your Ubuntu system. 

        Keep in mind that software and repositories can change over time, so you might want to check the official Podman [documentation](https://podman.io/docs/installation#ubuntu) 
    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Mac">
        On Mac, Podman is provided through [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Once you have set up brew, you can use the ```brew install``` command the install Podman. Use to following command to install:

        ```bash Terminal
        brew install podman
        ```
        You can then verify the installation information using following command:

        ```bash Terminal
        podman --version
        ```

        Next, Create and start your first podman machine named `orca`

        ```bash Terminal
        podman machine init orca
        podman machine start orca
        ```

       Verify the machine status

        ```bash Terminal
        podman machine ls
        ```

        <br />

        <Note>Podman also provide binaries and pkginstaller in their [GitHub release page](https://github.com/containers/podman/releases)</Note>


    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Windows">
        Download and install the latest version of Podman from [here](https://github.com/containers/podman/releases).

        Initialize podman machine named `orca`

        ```CMD cmd
        podman machine init orca
        ```

        Start podman machine named `orca`

        ```CMD cmd
        podman machine start orca
        ```

        <Note>You can check out the [Podman for Windows guide](https://github.com/containers/podman/blob/main/docs/tutorials/podman-for-windows.md) for setup and usage instructions.</Note>
